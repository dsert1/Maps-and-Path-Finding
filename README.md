This program was written by Deniz Sert the week of February 24, 2020.

It imports osm data from OpenStreetMap.org, which is processed into usable pickle files.
It can create a short or fast path from Point A to Point B. To run the server, go to terminal and type "python3 server.py edh",
which will load a visual representation of where I grew up.


The included screenshots "hs to innout - short" and "hs to innout - fast" are short and fast paths, respectively, from my
high school to In-n-Out Burger. 


It turns out that taking Silva Valley Parkway will get you there faster than taking
El Dorado Hills Parkway (which I wish I knew before).
